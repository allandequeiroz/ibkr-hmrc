Please complete the full onboarding sequence:

1. Read all files in docs/project_background
2. Read README.md and all MD files in docs/ root
4. Analyze ibkr-hmrc's source code in scripts/ and schema 
6. Read docs/discussions/ (all of them not only the ones in the root folder) sequentially
8. Read the config/project.conf, there's important decisions documented there as well
9 In case you need to inspect the DB, you'll need to write a one-off script and access using the same approach as any other script. There's not click-house client in this environment.

After completing all steps, confirm you've read everything and are ready to work.
